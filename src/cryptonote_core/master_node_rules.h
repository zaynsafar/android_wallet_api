  // Master node decommissioning: as master nodes stay up they earn "credits" (measured in blocks)
  // towards a future outage.  A new master node starts out with INITIAL_CREDIT, and then builds up
  // CREDIT_PER_DAY for each day the master node remains active up to a maximum of
  // DECOMMISSION_MAX_CREDIT.
  //
  // If a master node stops sending uptime proofs, a quorum will consider whether the master node
  // has built up enough credits (at least MINIMUM): if so, instead of submitting a deregistration,
  // it instead submits a decommission.  This removes the master node from the list of active
  // master nodes both for rewards and for any active network duties.  If the master node comes
  // back online (i.e. starts sending the required performance proofs again) before the credits run
  // out then a quorum will reinstate the master node using a recommission transaction, which adds
  // the master node back to the bottom of the master node reward list, and resets its accumulated
  // credits to RECOMMISSION_CREDIT (see below).  If it does not come back online within the
  // required number of blocks (i.e. the accumulated credit at the point of decommissioning) then a
  // quorum will send a permanent deregistration transaction to the network, starting a 30-day
  // deregistration count down.  (Note that it is possible for a server to slightly exceed its
  // decommission time: the first quorum test after the credit expires determines whether the server
  // gets recommissioned or decommissioned).




  // This determines how many credits a node gets when being recommissioned after being
  // decommissioned.  It gets passed two values: the credit at the time the node was decomissioned,
  // and the number of blocks the decommission lasted.  Note that it is possible for decomm_blocks
  // to be *larger* than credit_at_decomm: in particularl
  //
  // The default, starting in Beldex 8, subtracts two blocks for every block you were decomissioned,
  // or returns 0 if that value would be negative.  So, for example, if you had 1000 blocks of
  // credit and got decomissioned for 100 blocks, you will be recommissioned with 800 blocks of
  // credit.  If you got decomissioned for 500 or more you will be recommissioned with 0 blocks of
  // credit.
