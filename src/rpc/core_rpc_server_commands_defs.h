  // beldexd responding to the RPC request nor any other blockchain observers can (easily) obtain the

  //   the name hash using either hex or base64.).
  // - Calculate the decryption key as a 32-byte BLAKE2b keyed hash of the name using the
  //   (unkeyed) name hash calculated above as the hash key.
  // - Decrypt (and verify) using XChaCha20-Poly1305 (for example libsodium's
  //   crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt) using the above decryption key and using the
